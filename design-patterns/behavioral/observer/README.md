# Real-World Usage of Observer Design Pattern

The Observer design pattern finds applications in various real-world scenarios. Some of the common use cases include:

1. **Event-driven systems**: Observer pattern is commonly used in event-driven systems where different components or modules need to be notified when certain events occur. For example, in graphical user interfaces (GUI), UI elements like buttons and menus act as observers and are notified when a user interacts with them.

2. **Message queues and publish-subscribe systems**: Observer pattern is often used in messaging systems, where publishers publish messages, and subscribers receive those messages. Subscribers register themselves as observers to the desired topics or channels and are notified when new messages arrive.

3. **Stock market monitoring**: In stock market applications, multiple users or systems may be interested in monitoring the price changes of various stocks. The Observer pattern allows these observers to subscribe to specific stocks and receive updates whenever the prices change.

4. **Notifications and alerts**: Observer pattern is commonly used in notification systems, such as email or SMS notifications. Users subscribe to specific events or topics of interest and receive notifications when those events occur.

5. **Logging and auditing**: Observer pattern can be used for logging and auditing purposes. Observers can be implemented to record and log specific events or actions in the system for later analysis or auditing.

6. **Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture**: Observer pattern is an integral part of the MVC architecture, where the model notifies the registered views whenever its state changes. Views update themselves based on the changes in the model's state.
